Windows Programming Laboratory Work #3
======================================

Title
-----
Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.

##Contents
----------
- Mouse
- Device context
- GDI Primitives
   - Line
   - Curve
   - Plane
   - Bitmap image
- Bezier curve

##Mandatory Objectives (completed)
----------------------------------
- Draw few lines of different colors and weights.
- Draw a Bezier curve.
- Draw few plane objects of different colors, weights, filled and not.
- Draw 2 different objects using mouse.

##Objectives With Points (completed)
- Draw a custom bitmap image. **(1 pt)**
- Draw a Bezier curve using mouse. **(1 pt)**
##Application Creation Steps
----------------------------
I started to work to my application more complicated than previous but very interesting because of features . Some references a got from Petzold ,http://www.functionx.com/win32 and from my colleagues. I used many new things in my laboratory work for example adding bitmap image , working with mouse clicking ,drawing elements .

## Outro
--------

This laboratory was something new for me. For me the hardest part of this was Bezier curve and line .After many failures I did that.
