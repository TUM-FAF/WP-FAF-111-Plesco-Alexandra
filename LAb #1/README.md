## The application creation steps

First of all i set my mac os in such way that i may run the .exe program for Windows users.
The base of my laboratory work was stadart window input ,then i created all my elements that are presented in first.png so button "sign me", textbox ,listbox, the second button with smile .Then i wrote some function that permitted me to send my message that i write on textbox to listbox, also function for messageboxes . 
    



My guide was the book about Windows Programming by Charles Petzold
, wikibooks ,my colegues Mihai Iachimovschi and Rezantsev George also help me 



## Outro
Doing the laboratory work was certainly interesting ,but also very frustrating getting to understand 
. There were complications the most memorable of which was sending message to listbox . So that's it .
